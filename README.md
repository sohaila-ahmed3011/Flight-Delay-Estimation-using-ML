# Machine_Learning_Assignment_1
This is the solution for the Machine Learning Assignment. It aims to solve flight delay estimation task by using different ML models and algorithms. 
The src folder contains main1.py & main2.py including code documentation about each section within the py file.
The requirements.txt contains the required libraries

There are two python files as follow:

Trial(1): Models are used with one predictor (flight duration)

Trial(2): Models are used with three predictors (flight duration,Departure Airport, Destination Airport)

# Running the socurce code
- Just run the main1.py file and the results will be displayed for all models for trial 1. 
- Just run the main2.py file and the results will be displayed for all models for trial 2. 
- Ensure that all required libraries are installed first before running either of the two files.
