# Machine_Learning_Assignment_1
This is the solution for Machine Learning Assignment. It aims to solve fligt delay estimation problem by using different ML models. 
The src folder contains main.py code along with documentation about eachs section
The requirements.txt contains the required libraries

Trial(1): Models are used with one predictor (flight duration)

Trial(2): Models are used with three predictors (flight duration,Departure Airport, Destination Airport)

# Running the socurce code
Just run the main.py file and the results will be displayed for all models. Ensure that all required libraries are installed first
